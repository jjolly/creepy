Causally Responsive Entertainment Environment in Python

It is my purpose to create an AI environment that is able to have conversations with individuals and groups of individuals. This environment will be able to adapt responses based on the input from the users. This program will also have the ability to evolve it's own system if responses do not seem to be received appropriately.

It's like an Alice Bot, but it can rewrite itself.

It will be creepy.

This idea has been forming for a long time. It became a nascent reality for SUSE Hackweek 17 (July 2018).
